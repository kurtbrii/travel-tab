Title: Add Testing Baseline and CI Pipeline
ID: TT-002
Status: Draft
Type: chore
Owner: PO
Created: 2025-09-09

Summary
- Establish unit/component testing with Vitest + React Testing Library and a CI pipeline to run lint, typecheck, build, and tests on every PR.

Context
- No test framework or CI is configured. Architecture recommends Vitest and baseline tests for helpers/services.

Requirements
- Install and configure: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `jsdom`.
- Add scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`.
- Create `vitest.config.ts` and `tests/setup.ts` with RTL setup and jsdom environment.
- Add minimal tests for: `lib/status.ts` (to be added in TT-004), and `lib/api.ts` envelope helper (TT-004), plus a sample component test.
- Add GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running: install, lint, typecheck, test, build on Node LTS.

Acceptance Criteria
- `npm run test` executes and passes locally.
- CI runs on PRs to `main` and reports results for lint, typecheck, tests, and build.
- Coverage report generated by `npm run test:coverage`.

Tasks / Subtasks
1) Add dev deps and config for Vitest + RTL + jsdom.
2) Add `tests/setup.ts` and a sample test for an existing UI component (e.g., `StatusBadge`).
3) Add CI workflow with Node 20.x matrix (single value OK). Cache dependencies.
4) Document test commands in README.

Dependencies
- TT-004 provides `lib/status.ts` and `lib/api.ts` targets. This story can land first with a placeholder sample test, then expand in TT-004.

Risks
- Minimal; ensure Next 15 + React 19 play well with test environment (jsdom + RTL versions).

Out of Scope
- E2E testing; performance testing; full coverage goals.
