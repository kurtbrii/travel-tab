# Goals
- Help individual travelers plan a trip with conversational guidance and simple place suggestions.
- Enable users to authenticate, create trips, and attach a BorderBuddy module.
- Provide a chat-based experience (OpenAI) using trip details and a persisted context form.
- Generate a simple, text-only places list for the destination (no maps integration in MVP).
- Deliver a focused, scoped MVP that can be deployed and validated quickly.
