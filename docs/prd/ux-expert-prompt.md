# UX Expert Prompt
Design a responsive, accessible UI for TravelTabâ€™s MVP: Login/Register, Trips List, Create/Edit Trip, and Trip Detail with a BorderBuddy tab that includes: (1) a short Context Form, (2) Chat (LLM-backed), and (3) a simple Places List (text only, no maps). Prioritize clarity, validation, keyboard navigation, and visible focus states. Keep branding neutral and readable.
