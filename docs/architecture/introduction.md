# Introduction
This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing Travel Tab with a refactor focused on clean separation of concerns across the front end and backend, improved layering (transport/service/repository), and upgraded coding standards. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture**
This document supplements the current Next.js App Router monolith by defining standard layers and boundaries between UI, API handlers, domain/services, and data access. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document will guide consistent refactoring toward a clearer separation of concerns while preserving working functionality.
