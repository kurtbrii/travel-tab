# Existing Project Analysis

## Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** AI-powered travel compliance and trip management (user auth, trips CRUD, status tracking).
- **Current Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, JWT auth via httpOnly cookie, Zod for validation, ESLint (Next + TS).
- **Architecture Style:** Single Next.js application with serverless API routes; thin API handlers calling lib services; basic domain/utility separation.
- **Deployment Method:** Not documented. Assumption: Next.js on Vercel or a Node host; Prisma against managed Postgres.

## Available Documentation
- `docs/prd.md`, `docs/project-brief.md`, and a front-end spec.
- No prior `docs/architecture.md` found. No explicit ADRs.
- No formal API contract docs; implicit via `src/app/api/*` handlers.

## Identified Constraints
- Env dependencies: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` required; failures if missing.
- Prisma client duplication: both `src/lib/db.ts` and `src/lib/prisma.ts` export clients; risk of multiple instances/import confusion.
- Auth: JWT verified in server context; middleware uses presence-only check (cannot verify JWT in Edge), so protected routes rely on cookie existence, not full verification.
- Data modeling: UI status strings differ from enum; mapping handled in `lib/trips.ts`. Risk of drift; consider canonical mapping utilities.
- Source anomaly: `src/components/Users/brii/Desktop/.../icons/index.tsx` appears accidental; should be removed.
- Testing framework not configured; no automated coverage gate.
- No centralized error model/Result type for API handlers; ad-hoc responses across routes.
