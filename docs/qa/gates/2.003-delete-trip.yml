top_issues:
  - 'Ensure atomic cascading deletion via DB FKs (ON DELETE CASCADE) or single transaction covering all related records.'
  - 'Enforce owner check server-side; consider 404 vs 403 to avoid existence disclosure.'
  - 'Handle idempotency/double-submit; disable confirm and ensure repeated calls are safe.'
  - 'Revalidate/invalidate list cache after delete to prevent stale UI.'

      - 'Add integration tests verifying cascade removal across BorderBuddy/context/places/chat.'
      - 'Ensure transactional delete or FK cascade to prevent partial state.'
      - 'Decide and document 403 vs 404 policy; keep response generic.'
      - 'Track telemetry for confirm/cancel/success/failure.'
