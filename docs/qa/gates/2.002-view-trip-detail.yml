gate: 'PASS'
status_reason: 'Scope and ACs are clear and testable. Owner-only access with 404 is specified; tabs require ARIA compliance; back navigation preserves query state. Risks (open redirect via returnTo, timezone formatting, SSR caching of personalized content) have straightforward mitigations.'

top_issues:
  - 'Sanitize/validate returnTo to avoid open redirect; prefer history.back() with safe fallback.'
  - 'Ensure accessible tabs per ARIA APG (roles, aria-selected, focus management).'
  - 'Disable shared caching for user-scoped SSR responses.'

    monitor:
      - 'Validate returnTo or use safe back behavior.'
      - 'Add integration tests for 404 on non-owner and stateful back.'
